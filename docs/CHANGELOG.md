You don't need more to specify `a, b, mark, code` manually. This feature will be added to fields that supports inline markup.
- `New` *Block Selection* â€” Ability to select Block by `CMD+A`, and the whole Editor by double `CMD+A`. After that, you can copy (`CMD+C`), remove (`Backspace`) or clear (`Enter`) selected Blocks.

Custom Paste Event should be handled by `onPaste(event)` that should not be static from now.
- `Changes` *Tools API* â€” options `displayInToolbox ` and `toolboxIcon` was removed. Use [`toolbox`](https://github.com/codex-team/codex.editor/blob/master/docs/tools.md#internal-tool-settings) instead, that should return object with `icon` and `title` field, or `false` if Tool should not be placed at the Toolbox.
